    <dd>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and analyze
        data. Python is a general-purpose language, not specialized for any specific problems, and used to create
        various programmes. This versatility and its beginner-friendliness have made it one of the most used programming
        languages today. In 2020, more than one-third of Indian IT professionals said Python was their preferred
        programming language . It continues to top lists of the most desired programming languages in the country.</dd>


    <blockquote><b><i>The name Python comes from Monty Python. When Guido van Rossum was creating Python, he was also
                reading the scripts from BBC's Monty Python's Flying Circus. He thought the name Python was
                appropriately
                short and slightly mysterious.

    <h1>What is Python Used For?</h1>
    <p>
        Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data
        visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as
        accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.

        "Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity," says University of Michigan and Coursera
        instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. "You can write programs for many reasons,
        ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone
        else solve a problem."

            Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the
            language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualisations, build machine learning
            algorithms, manipulate and analyse data, and complete other data-related tasks.

            Python can build various data visualisations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histogrammes, and 3D
            plots. Python also has many libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine
            learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.

        <p class="pytparagraph2">
            Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application—the parts that a user doesn’t see.
            Python's role in web development includes sending data to and from servers, processing data and
            communicating with databases, routing URLs, and ensuring security. Python offers several frameworks for web
            development. Commonly used ones include Django and Flask.

            Some web development jobs that use Python include back-end engineers, full-stack engineers, Python
            developers, software engineers, and DevOps engineers.
