    <dt><b>Definition</b></dt>
    <dd>Cryptography is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for
        can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be
        used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce.</dd>
    <h3 class="crypt3">History Of Cyptography</h3>
    <p>Modern cryptography techniques include algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of
        information, such as 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys. Modern ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption
        Standard (AES), are considered virtually unbreakable.

        A common cryptography definition is the practice of coding information to ensure only the person that a message
        was written for can read and process the information. This cybersecurity practice, also known as cryptology,
        combines various disciplines like computer science, engineering, and mathematics to create complex codes that
        hide the true meaning of a message.

        Cryptography can be traced all the way back to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics but remains vital to securing
        communication and information in transit and preventing it from being read by untrusted parties. It uses
        algorithms and mathematical concepts to transform messages into difficult-to-decipher codes through techniques
        like cryptographic keys and digital signing to protect data privacy, credit card transactions, email, and web
        browsing.</p>

            <b>Importance Of Cryptography</b><br>
            Cryptography remains important to protecting data and users, ensuring confidentiality, and preventing cyber
            criminals from intercepting sensitive corporate information. Common uses and examples of cryptography
            include
            the following:<br>
            <b>Privacy and confidentiality</b><br>
            Individuals and organizations use cryptography on a daily basis to protect their privacy and keep their
            conversations and data confidential. Cryptography ensures confidentiality by encrypting sent messages using
            an algorithm with a key only known to the sender and recipient. A common example of this is the messaging
            tool WhatsApp, which encrypts conversations between people to ensure they cannot be hacked or
            intercepted.<br>
            <b>Integrity</b><br>
            Similar to how cryptography can confirm the authenticity of a message, it can also prove the integrity of
            the information being sent and received. Cryptography ensures information is not altered while in storage or
            during transit between the sender and the intended recipient. For example, digital signatures can detect
            forgery or tampering in software distribution and financial transactions.<br>

            <b>Nonrepudiation</b><br>
            Cryptography confirms accountability and responsibility from the sender of a message, which means they
            cannot later deny their intentions when they created or transmitted information. Digital signatures are a
            good example of this, as they ensure a sender cannot claim a message, contract, or document they created to
            be fraudulent. Furthermore, in email nonrepudiation, email tracking makes sure the sender cannot deny
            sending a message and a recipient cannot deny receiving it.

    <h2 class="crpth2">Types Of Cryptographic Algorithms</h2>
    <ol></ol>
    There are many types of cryptographic algorithms available. They vary in complexity and security, depending on the
    type of communication and the sensitivity of the information being shared.

    <li><b>Secret Key Cryptography</b><br>
        Secret key cryptography, also known as symmetric encryption, uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt a message.
        The
        sender encrypts the plaintext message using the key and sends it to the recipient who then uses the same key to
        decrypt it and unlock the original plaintext message.</li><br>

    <li><b>Stream Ciphers</b><br>
        Stream ciphers work on a single bit or byte at any time and constantly change the key using feedback mechanisms.
        A
        self-synchronizing stream cipher ensures the decryption process stays in sync with the encryption process by
        recognizing where it sits in the bit keystream. A synchronous stream cipher generates the keystream
        independently of
        the message stream and generates the same keystream function at both the sender and the receiver.</li><br>

    <li><b>Block Ciphers</b><br>
        Block ciphers encrypt one block of fixed-size data at a time. It will always encrypt a plaintext data block to
        the
        same ciphertext when the same key is used. A good example of this is the Feistel cipher, which uses elements of
        key
        expansion, permutation, and substitution to create vast confusion and diffusion in the cipher.</li><br>

    The stages of encryption and decryption are similar if not identical, which means reversing the key reduces the code
    size and circuitry required for implementing the cipher in a piece of software or hardware.
